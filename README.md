# Real-Time Accident Detection in Traffic Surveillance (Pr/5)

## Overview  
The *Real-Time Accident Detection in Traffic Surveillance* project leverages deep learning (CNN) and Python to detect traffic accidents in real-time. This system aims to enhance road safety by enabling rapid emergency response, minimizing casualties, and reducing the impact of road accidents. This innovative approach addresses the challenges of increasing vehicle numbers and accidents, particularly in high-risk regions.
